### Context
This assignment tackles breast cancer prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on a dataset of approximately 600 samples (provided as a CSV). The assignment is divided into three parts: implementing early stopping regularization with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and evaluating its performance, implementing mini-batch SGD and comparing it to standard SGD, and finally, exploring active learning techniques to minimize the number of training samples required for optimal SVM performance. The goal is to develop and compare different SVM training strategies for accurate and efficient breast cancer classification.


### Dataset
The dataset has been downloaded from [this](`https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html`) source and shared by the professor as a `data.csv` file, loaded by the python script.

### Report
Will be added at a later date.
