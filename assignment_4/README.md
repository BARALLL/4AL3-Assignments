#### Context and Dataset
The first part of this assignment focuses on image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We use the [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset from Zalando, containing 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items across 10 categories. The task is to build and evaluate a CNN model, comparing its performance to established benchmarks.

The second part explores algorithmic decision-making in the public sector, specifically focusing on the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) system used to assess recidivism risk. We will be using the [ProPublica dataset](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis) (available as part of their 2016 expos√©), which contains information on 11,757 individuals scored by COMPAS for both general recidivism and violent crime risk. The goal is to explore potential biases and ethical implications of this system.
