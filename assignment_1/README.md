#### Datasets
##### Part 1
The dataset `gdp-vs-happiness` for part 1 (`part_I.py`) can be downloaded from this source: [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction)

It need to be preprocessed using the `Linear_Regression.py` file (credits goes to author) into a `gdp-vs-happiness.csv` file.

##### Part 2
The dataset `Abalone` for part 2 (`part_II.py`) can be downloaded from this source: [Abalone - UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone).
The dataset file is expected to be called `training_data.csv`.

#### Report
The python files contain detailed comments explaining the thought process. A report could be available later on.
