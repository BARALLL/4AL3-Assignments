### Context
#### Part 1
This section focuses on building a linear regression model using gradient descent to explore the relationship between a country's happiness score and its GDP (as a measure of richness). The goal is to implement gradient descent, experimenting with various learning rates and epochs, and subsequently compare the resulting regression line to one obtained using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.


#### Part 2
This part involves building both a linear and a polynomial regression model to predict the age of abalone based on physical characteristics like length, weight, and diameter. The objective is to predict the "rings" variable (which correlates to age) using seven provided features, training and testing the model on a subset of the data, and ultimately evaluating its performance on a held-out test set.


### Datasets
#### Part 1
The dataset `gdp-vs-happiness` for part 1 (`part_I.py`) can be downloaded from this source: [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction)

It need to be preprocessed using the `Linear_Regression.py` file (credits goes to author) into a `gdp-vs-happiness.csv` file.

#### Part 2
The dataset `Abalone` for part 2 (`part_II.py`) can be downloaded from this source: [Abalone - UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone).
The dataset file is expected to be called `training_data.csv`.

### Report
The python files contain detailed comments explaining the thought process. A report could be available later on.
